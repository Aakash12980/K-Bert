coronary artery disease the patient was continued on aspirin and loaded with plavix upon admission the patient was anticoagulated with mg kg doses of lovenox the patient was started on beta blocker and given mg of lipitor the patient underwent diagnostic cardiac catheterization on the day of admission which showed right dominant system with no significant left main lesions the patient did have proximal lad lesion as well as proximal left circumflex lesion estimated to be about the patient also had mid circumflex lesion that was also estimated at the right coronary artery had proximal diffuse lesion and distal tubular lesion right pda had tubular lesion in the mid portion as well as discrete lesion in the proximal pa as the patient was found to have three vessel disease and history of diabetes surgical revascularization was considered the patient was evaluated by the cardiothoracic surgical service who discussed the case at length with the attending cardiologist on service in the end it was decided by both the attending cardiologist and the attending cardiothoracic surgeon in contact with the patient and his wife that the best option at this time was for percutaneous intervention as it was thought that the patient would have significant difficulty postoperatively because of his significant dementia we felt that the patient would have difficult time with the necessary rehabilitation following cabg and that percutaneous intervention would indeed be the best option therefore the patient underwent repeat cardiac catheterization the patient had cypher stent placed to the mid lad lesion the om lesion was also stented with cypher stent across the non diseased ostium of om and then the proximal left circumflex lesion was also stented with cypher stent the final angiograms during this catheterization showed no residual stenosis or dissection the plan was for the patient to return on an outpatient basis for potential percutaneous intervention to the pda plv and stenting of the left renal artery which was found to be stenotic and likely contributing to the patients refractory hypertension and chronic kidney disease the patient did well following his percutaneous interventions and he was discharged on regimen including aspirin plavix toprol and zocor the patient will follow up with dr ruud in the next few weeks for possible repeat percutaneous

she had been in her usual state of health until approximately on the day of admission when at that time she suddenly became short of breath she reports that she then sat down in her wheelchair and passed out however it is unclear if the patient actually lost consciousness the patient also developed jaw pain radiating to her back while emts were present and also complained of tug in her chest the pain was unrelieved by nitroglycerin oxygen it was constant in nature at the time of her arrival in the emergency room the patient was hemodynamically stable with an sat of on room air she was given sublingual nitrate with no effect because of her history of coronary artery disease she was tried on heparin and aspirin past medical history pulmonary fibrosis on home reported history of an

hematocrit was her dimer was her ekg showed normal sinus at low voltages poor wave progression impression at the time of admission the patient was year old female with morbid obesity and chronic episodes of shortness of breath this time accompanied by jaw pain and with history of coronary artery disease and multiple risk factors concerning for acute coronary syndrome the patient was initially treated for possible ischemic event diagnosis of pe results were considered however the patient was not tachycardic she did not have any chest pain or new requirements and had had several workups for pulmonary embolism during prior hospitalization with similar systems so therefore this was thought to be less likely hospital course by system cardiac in terms of ischemia the patient had tests of cardiac enzymes which returned negative she was maintained on telemetry and she had ekg checked which did not reveal any changes this was patient who had dobutamine mibi which was negative for any evidence of ischemic changes during the mibi there was no evidence of ischemia and or scar the patient was continued on her outpatient medications including aspirin zocor and atenolol however at later point in her hospitalization she became hypotensive at which time her atenolol was temporarily dcd but this was restarted prior to discharge in terms of the patients cardiac function she has history of chf and is on lasix as an outpatient an echocardiogram was repeated during this hospitalization which was notable for an ef of trace to mild mr moderate tr and estimated pulmonary systolic pressure at mmhg the patient was continued on outpatient lasix regimen until at later point during this hospitalization the patient became hypertensive with acute renal failure at which time her lasix was discontinued lasix was restarted prior to discharge in terms of the patients rhythm she had no evidence of arrhythmias monitored throughout her hospitalization gi on the patient developed acute onset of diarrhea and lower abdominal pain now this pain was nonradiating alternating sharp and dull but constant associated with nausea and vomiting and frequent stools at times the stools were notable for bright red blood the patient was therefore started on levofloxacin and flagyl as treatment for diverticulitis versus ischemic colitis to further evaluate this ct scan of the abdomen was done which was notable for thickened colon for cm at the hepatic flexure given this information it was the gi consults opinion that this is most likely consistent with diverticulitis and the plan was to treat it aggressively with antibiotics and once the symptoms resolved recommended colonoscopy several weeks after discharge the patient was continued on levofloxacin and flagyl but then several days later became hypotensive with systolic blood pressures in the at this time the patients antibiotic coverage was changed to include ceptaz and vancomycin and she also received dose of gentamicin by the time of discharge the patients abdominal symptoms have completely resolved she is no longer having any abdominal pain and she needs no longer having any diarrhea and is tolerating regular diet without any difficulties the plan is for her to have followup colonoscopy as an outpatient pulmonary the patient was admitted for shortness of breath differential diagnosis at that time included chronic pulmonary embolism versus cardiac etiology versus deconditioning in the setting of chronic pulmonary fibrosis to establish that the patient did not have any pe she had lower extremity doppler exams which were negative she also had pt protocol ct which was negative for any evidence of clots because the patient does have cardiopulmonary hypertension she was started on coumadin as prophylaxis for any thrombosis in the setting of her low flow in her pulmonary vasculature throughout this hospitalization she was continued on her own home regimen of renal the patient has baseline chronic renal insufficiency with baseline creatinine at during this hospitalization at time that her diarrhea was very severe and when her blood pressures fell in the the patient developed acute renal failure with peak creatinine of with decreased urine output the thought of the team was that this represented renal failure in the setting of her diarrhea fluid losses and hypertension her pheno was consistent with this at she was treated with aggressive iv fluids she also had renal ultrasound which was normal she did have day of hematuria which was thought to be due most likely to foley trauma which resolved at the time of discharge id the patients hospital course was notable for diarrhea as mentioned in gi she was initially treated with levofloxacin and flagyl and then when she became hypertensive was then change her flagyl ceptaz and vancomycin with dose of gentamicin her symptoms dramatically improved on these antibiotics on she was changed from iv antibiotics to regimen of flagyl and levofloxacin the plan is for her to continue total of days of antibiotics anticipate the last day of antibiotic coverage will be rheumatology on the patient was noted to have left knee pain and was noted to have some focal lateral patellar tenderness and swelling knee aspirate was performed and urate crystals were identified and the patient was diagnosed with gout because of her chronic renal insufficiency and diarrhea the decision was made to treat her gout flare with steroids and she is currently is on steroid taper as treatment endocrine the patient has history of diabetes she takes insulin at home she was initially continued on an outpatient regimen however when she started to begin having massive diarrhea she was taken off her long acting insulin because she was not taking anything by at this time she was not tolerating regular diet and her insulin requirements were increasing it is recommended that as an outpatient she resumes one half of her regular outpatient insulin dose for or days to ensure that her insulin requirements in her diet are appropriate and then she should resume her regular insulin dosage discharge medications include aspirin mg atenolol mg lasix mg zoloft mg zocor mg neurontin mg levofloxacin mg coumadin mg prednisone taper which involves mg of prednisone on followed by mg of prednisone on and and then stop flagyl mg insulin units units

node uterolithotomy on the right side liver biopsy cystoscopy placement of double ureteral stent on the right side and open nephrolithotomy the large right ureteral stone was found upon exploration and urology was called for an intraoperative consult please see both dr moriarity and dr cushard dictated reports for more information there was very high amount of blood loss approximately liters intraoperatively from venous plexus bleeding of the pelvis and kidney and the patient was closed after stomach mobilization without resection of his tumor and admitted to the angeles vandie morepa surgical intensive care unit the patient was left intubated due to his large fluid and blood product replacement and surrounding facial edema he was kept intubated paralyzed and sedated started on lopressor put on rule out mi protocol kept npo with an ng tube his electrolytes cbc and coagulation labs were corrected the patient had multiple abdominal drains and was kept on triple antibiotics over the next several days the patient was kept intubated and sedated his chest rays revealed some early ards and he continued to need blood product including red cell and platelet and ffp transfusions he underwent bronchoscopy in the intensive care unit and was slowly weaned on his valve dilatory settings over postop day and the patient began to spike some fevers up to he had been weaned to pressure support ventilation and was beginning to auto diurese he then started on tube feeds of small amounts which were increased as tolerated over the next couple of days as the patients sedation was weaned and he woke up more it was noticed that he had decreased movement of his left lower extremity and upon examination and given his recurrent fevers there was question of an epidural hematoma he was scheduled for an mri to assess this he was tolerating tube feeds well and these were increased and his labs were stabilizing neurosurgery was consulted and it was ascertained that the patient did have an epidural hematoma therefore his epidural was removed and this was deemed likely to be secondary to trauma from the epidural it was decided that the patient would benefit from evacuation of epidural hematoma and the patient was made npo and taken back to the operating room on he underwent laminectomy with evacuation of the epidural hematoma please see the dictated operative report for more information but handful of clot was removed from the area the patient was transferred back to or ox nor intubated and stable having tolerated the procedure well thereafter the patient was more awake and alert and more quickly weaned off his ventilatory support his fingersticks were more difficult to control and he was therefore started on the heartland protocol and was seen by the diabetes management service the patient was extubated on and was doing well on face mask on that day his tube feeds were restarted and speech and swallow was consulted to evaluate the patient he began to be seen by physical therapy for his lower extremity weakness the cardiology service was consulted on and asked to optimize medical management of the patients ischemic cardiomyopathy they recommended discontinuing and titrating the patients lopressor he had been somewhat tachycardic previously and this resolved shortly speech and swallow saw the patient and initially cleared him for soft foods and thickened foods and this was likely just due to endotracheal tube trauma after another day or two they cleared him for all regular foods including thin liquids without any restrictions for the patients epidural hematoma he had been started on vancomycin and it was decided that he would get total of three week course of vancomycin urology continued to followed the patient and wanted at least one blake drain kept in place and the foley catheter kept in place the patient did have ct scan on which demonstrated no urine leak on the ct urogram the patient continued to be seen by physical therapy every day and was doing very well it was very difficulty initially to normalize him but by the time of discharge he was up walking with the walker with physical therapy and doing quite well infectious disease was consulted to confirm the three week course of vancomycin was appropriate for the patients epidural hematoma and they agreed and thought no other interventions or treatment as needed at the time the patient was transferred out of the intensive care unit on neuro at this time he was getting increasingly more oriented he had had some icu psychosis and confusion and he was taking no pain medication he was stable from his neurosurgery procedure and neurosurgery was following him pulmonary his lungs were clear he was now stable on room air from cardiovascular

weeks he had picc line placed on which was put in good position from an endocrine standpoint he was placed on glyburide continued to be followed by diabetes and also on humalog scale from an activity standpoint he was seen by physical therapy every day over the ensuing few days he was begun on calorie counts to see how much of the diet he was tolerating and he continued to work with physical therapy his glyburide and insulin doses were tweaked little bit by the diabetes management service and he was improving every day as was his mental status he had been discharged from the unit with one

mild to moderate mr lvh and normal function blowing diastolic murmur was noted on physical exam at that time on the patient underwent an ett that was nondiagnostic due to baseline ekg abnormalities however he had no substernal chest pain after minutes and seconds around the end of october the patient noted increasing fatigue increased temperature and some upper respiratory symptoms including cough and sore throat he claims that his sore throat lasted for nearly month then went away for one week only to return again for nearly one month he had been treated with amoxicillin without improvement one week prior to admission he had persistent symptoms with cough with poor sputum production but the sputum that was produced was yellow green in color he was treated with erythromycin in single dose before hospitalization also one week prior to admission he noted some left chest pain without radiation that is typical of his chest pain syndrome which had been previously diagnosed on the day of admission the patient noted increased persistent elevation in his temperature and chest ray showed questionable left lingular infiltrate that led to his admission past medical history noteable for history of adult onset diabetes previously treated with insulin but now diet controlled status post porcine avr secondary to rheumatic heart disease atypical chest pain syndrome

was lvh with strain chest ray showed questionable lingular infiltrate that was read as such by one radiologist but this was not confirmed by second radiologist there was no sign of congestive heart failure on chest ray hospital course when the patient was admitted he was initially treated as if his presenting symptoms were due to left lingular pneumonia despite his lack of elevated white count however it was felt that endocarditis small though real possibility in this gentleman with avr therefore he was originally treated with ampicillin grams iv six hours gentamicin mg iv eight hours and erythromycin gram iv six hours to cover atypical bacteria including legionella prior to administering antibiotics three blood cultures were obtained at dh in addition to the two previously obtained at tp sputum sample was also sent for gram stain and all blood cultures remained negative throughout the hospitalization sputum culture showed only normal flora when the second radiologist read the chest ray as being inconsistent with lingular pneumonia more aggressive search for possible endocarditis was undertaken an echocardiogram was performed on that showed an aortic valve with mm gradient ai mr mild lvf and no regional wall motion abnormalities there was no evidence of vegetation on the echo side by side comparison of this echocardiogram with the echocardiogram from done at lgmc sho wed no significant interval change an infectious disease consult was sought and it was felt by these consultants that endocarditis was an unlikely diagnosis given the lack of change in echocardiogram and lack of additional signs of sbe it was ultimately felt that the patients shortness of breath and elevated temperature were due to bronchitis and he was switched to po bactrim to continue ten day course of therapy although the initial goal of his hospitalization was to keep him hospitalized until cardiac catheterization and valve replacement could be performed the patients personal situation made it unfeasible to keep him in the hospital for longer period of time than absolutely necessary furthermore there were questions about whether cardiac catheterization and avr should be performed in someone being treated for presumed acute bronchitis and whether his very poor oral hygiene and dental work can be corrected prior to surgery for these reasons dr sagredo in cardiology was consulted as well as dr sturman in vwh medicine and both concurred that the patient could be discharged with close follow up by his primary care physician dr peltier his co ndition on discharge was stable

outmoded medication however because she has been on it so long it has not been discontinued however she has been noted to suffer from some mild depression osteoarthritis affecting mostly the hands and

for balance incidentally she says it is because she needs shoes for arthritis marked pronation of the ankle on small steps labs sodium potassium chloride bun and creatinine glucose calcium magnesium was normal rpr nonreactive pfts normal phenobarb level not detected tox screen positive for benzodiazepine this may have been due to sedation she received for the ct however it is not clear that she received sedation hematocrit with mcv of platelets white count polys lymphs monos eo and basophils pt ptt ct periventricular white matter disease slightly increased density above the sella hospital course this is an elderly woman with hypertension myasthenia gravis and arthritis who presented with weakness of her right lower extremity and right hand and some confusion as evidenced by using knife to eat her cereal instead of spoon her exam was notable for mildly impaired attention possibly confused clock difficulty with handwriting and decreased strength of the right hand and likely probably decreased strength to the right lower extremity hip flexors is based on the relative difficulty with heel to shin on the right old findings on exam included abnormalities of the right eye muscles decreased left palpebral fissure and sensory findings in the left lower extremities as well as reflexes her presentation was consistent with possible small vessel stroke affecting the arm and leg more than the face this could have occurred in the pons area or the internal capsule the component of confusion however is less explainable based on deep lesion such as this and raised the possibility of small cortical insult mri showed no territorial stroke just intense abnormalities in the periventricular white matter corona radiata and centrum semiovalle suggestive of small vessel disease echo and holter were not suggestive of cardioembolic disease echo showed normal lv size preserved lv function with estimated ejection fraction of there is also mild lvh no thrombus was seen there was aortic sclerosis with mildly regurgitation mild thickening of the mitral valve leaflets with mild mitral regurgitation and bubble study was negative holter was sinus rhythm at to beats per minute occasional frequent apbs atrial couplets five runs of svt ranging from to beats with heart rates to occasionally only frequent vpbs at all hours and one ventricular couplet carotid noninvasive studies showed no significant hemodynamic lesions of note on the mri the basilar artery appeared to be small caliber and the carotid showed some calcification on carotid noninvasive studies however there was only minimal plaque in the carotid arteries in summary it appears that ms epperly had small vessel stroke she showed some critical improvement during hospital stay and was able to walk without assistance on the second hospital day she also had improved right hand function and appeared to be less confused we recommended starting enteric coated aspirin which she is to take one per day in the setting of the acute stroke we did not control her blood pressure aggressively her pressures ranged from systolics of to averaging around to with diastolics usually in the we have suggested that she discontinue the use of her reserpine as intermittent use is problematic especially with this medication and she admits to intermittent use as well as the fact that she has suffered from some mild depression that can be associated with reserpine she will be started on an alternative blood pressure as an out patient with dr scotton in the next week we did not wish to start this medication in the acute setting she will likely be started on an ace inhibitor for blood pressure control we also suggested that she discontinue the use of phenobarbital for sleep as this might contribute to confusion finally since she is on prednisone and mestinon we asked the patient whether she was taking gi prophylaxis evidently she only does this intermittently as well she may be on carefate however we suggested taking an blocker once in the evening and have provided her with the prescription for zantac mg she will follow up with dr milosch her primary doctor at ni health as well as dr salmen at the ont hospital for

by right pleural effusion of moderate size the patient also had pet scan in early august which showed that the consolidation lit up extensively review of these studies prompted consideration of possible pneumonia versus bronchioalveolar carcinoma spread pulmonary was consulted and they suggested starting the patient on antibiotics for possible postobstructive pneumonia she was started on levofloxacin vancomycin and flagyl on she received days of these antibiotics while in hospital on day of her hospitalization thoracentesis was performed for both diagnostic and therapeutic reasons the pleural fluid demonstrated transudative picture gram stain was negative cultures did not grow anything cytology preliminary read was negative she had white blood cells and red blood cells approximately ml were removed and the patient felt much less short of breath following the thoracentesis requiring much less oxygen followup ct scan was obtained which showed continued infiltrate in the right lower lobe with decreased right pleural effusion no pneumothorax was observed radiology felt that her consolidation was most likely consistent with pneumonia and that it was not postobstructive given that the bronchioles were in fact quite patent and thus it was decided that the patient would continue day course of levofloxacin with followup with pulmonary to consider whether

symptoms assessment on admission she was an year old woman with known coronary artery disease here with chief complaint of worsening shortness of breath consistent with congestive heart failure exacerbation most likely left sided diastolic dysfunction there was no clear etiology however dietary or medication issues were not likely given the patients excellent awareness and involvement in her care the suspicion was that the patient may have had increasing blood hypertension out of control increasing oxygen demand and creating diastolic function and pulmonary edema the role of her aortic valve was unclear however there may have been gradual progression and renal artery stenosis can not be rule out as an etiology hospital course cardiovascular in terms of her cardiovascular system she was diuresed with iv lasix and her electrolytes were followed closely she came in with weight of kg and left with weight of kg for two days in the middle she was diuresed with iv lasix mg and she was converted to oral lasix and actually continued her diuresis in fact after pacemaker placement which will be noted below she may have actually continued to urinate even more so on the last day of her admission her blood pressure was stable throughout her stay in the low consistently below systolic and above systolic rhythm in terms of her rhythm she was found at several points throughout her stay in the first several days to have bradycardia consistent with junctional rhythm and because of her atrial fibrillation treated with amiodarone it was thought she would benefit from pacemaker also because of her beta blocker so pacemaker was placed on without complications the pacemaker was dual chamber ppm her inr before it was placed was and there was some oozing from the site however her hematocrit was stable and her hemodynamics were stable for hours after the procedure electrophysiologists analyzed the device and found that it was working properly she is scheduled for follow up with dr gutirrez on at in the morning she has been advised to limit her driving until that appointment she has also been advised that she will not be able to have an mri in the future she will be discharged on keflex cephalexin mg times day for days on discharge for her pacemaker and if she has any problems at all with her pacemaker she should call dr richel at telephone adetc pulmonary the

the mid range not depending on where the probe was placed she was unable to be weaned from the oxygen and will be sent home on oxygen she should be followed up with ct of the chest ct of the chest was done on this admission however it was consistent with chf and other things could not be ruled out of note on the chest ct there were found to be liver lesions which will be commented on below the patient should also be worked up for her pulmonary issues radiology the patient had this chest ct which showed multifocal bilateral ground glass opacities in the lungs diffuse haziness some septal thickening with slight basil predominance multiple borderline mediastinal nodes in the anterior mediastinum an ap window region with the largest node on image measuring cm there were extensive vascular calcifications cardiomegaly with multi chamber enlargement and particularly dense coronary calcifications trace right and left pleural effusions visualized organs of the upper abdomen demonstrate multiple ill defined low attenuation foci in the liver but no other abnormality review of bone window shows extensive thoracic degenerative change sternal wires and epicardial pacer leads the lung findings were consistent with cardiomegaly and chf but could not rule out other diagnostic possibilities including atypical pneumonia hypersensitivity pulmonary hemorrhage or less likely lymphangitic tumor in order to workup the liver mass an ultrasound of the abdomen was attained the liver showed mass cm it was hyperechoic in the posterior segment of the right lobe of the liver corresponding to the dominant mass seen in the ct of and gallbladder was normal with no stones the biliary tree was normal as were the right kidney and left kidney pancreas although it was poorly visualized the spleen was normal the aorta was normal pleural effusion was noted on the left which was small and prominent hepatic veins were noted the radiologists impression was that the ectogenic mass on the right lower lobe of the kidney corresponded in the location of the mass reported on prior cts may be hemangioma or other ectogenic masses which could not be excluded and he noted that the patient could not hold her breath sufficiently well to evaluate the mass with doppler if indicated the pmd should either get nuclear scan ct the radiologist suggested mri but that is now impossible given the pacemaker for confirmation and further evaluation also it was noted that she had prominent hepatic veins possibly due to the right heart failure other issues endocrine the patient was continued on her levoxyl and her home dose of insulin with good blood sugar controls generally below fingerstick of heme the patient was continued on her niferex her hematocrit was stable throughout

arrived at the scene and he had the following code status mentioned above with vf arrest and then pea arrest on arrival to tonwa medical center he had heart rate of blood pressure and respiratory rate he was given normal saline liters dopamine drip lopressor mg iv push and he was paralyzed at which point it was determined that the patient would likely need urgent cardiac catheterization for

in distal anastomosis with flow and tilting disk aortic valve that appears to be functioning normally in summary the patient had what was considered to be nonintervenable coronary artery disease and thus he was admitted for medical management he received optimal medical management for his acute myocardial infarction including aspirin and plavix statin beta blocker ace inhibitor as tolerated his ischemic ekg changes have resolved at the time of transfer out of the coronary care unit and he has been chest pain free for the remainder of that day his ck peaked at on pump the patient was

episode of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate up to the associated with hypotension for which he was electively cardioverted with shock to normal sinus rhythm after which he was loaded with amio load and he has remained in normal sinus rhythm since that episode however after the patient had been transferred to the floor and was stable he received single lead aicd given his history

electrocardiogram in clinic showed wide complex tachycardia and left bundle branch block her chest ray showed no pulmonary edema or infiltrate hospital course this patient is year old woman with significant ischemic heart disease who was admitted with wide complex tachycardia cardiovascular ischemia the patients abnormal rhythm was presumed to be ventricular tachycardia given her history of severe ischemic heart disease once her tachycardia was stabilized she was taken to catheterization which showed patent grafts she did have small increase in her troponin but this was thought to be related to demand she did not have any complaints of chest pain during the hospitalization we continued her on her beta blocker and initially held her digoxin while we were controlling her rhythm she was slightly hypotensive during her episodes of tachycardia so we initially held her accupril as well but her medications were resumed few days before discharge pump at the time of admission the patient was classified as having class ii heart failure although she did admit to not being very active and it was felt that if the patient exerted herself more she would have more symptoms on her catheterization her pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was found to be with normal right atrial pressure she also had repeat echocardiogram which showed an ejection fraction of with mr and thick aortic and mitral valve she did not exhibit any signs of volume overload during her hospitalization and we continued her home dose of lasix we also kept her on two liter fluid restriction but her creatinine soon began to increase from baseline level of to peak of the patient did admit that she drank significantly larger amount of fluid at home and so she was quite hypovolemic in comparison to what she was normally used to as result we liberalized her fluid restriction and her creatinine normalized rhythm when the patient arrived her tachycardia resolved and she was in normal sinus rhythm however later that evening she went back into ventricular tachycardia she had stayed in ventricular tachycardia with her heart rate often reaching the for several minutes at time her blood pressure was always stable in the she denied any chest pain she was given an amiodarone load of mg iv over minutes and also started on load of mg over the next two days she continued to have episodes of sustained ventricular tachycardia for five minutes at time and ultimately her ventricular tachycardia progressed so that she would have episodes of minutes at time when she became symptomatic she was started on an amiodarone drip this was done through peripheral line and after several hours the patient developed mild phlebitis she was taken off the drip and placed again on amiodarone her vtac was thought to be primarily due to her ischemic cardiomyopathy and we discussed the need for an icd with her she was reluctant but ultimately agreed we did also discuss the possibility of an ep study and ablation but the patient preferred the least invasive method possible while the patient was currently in compensated heart failure as mentioned previously it was felt that this was because she did not exert herself any further and that it was likely that she would within the next year or two decompensate and have more symptoms of congestive heart failure because of the severity of her disease dual chamber pacemaker was also placed at the same time as the icd the patient tolerated the procedure well by the time of discharge her amiodarone was decreased to this will likely be decreased to as an

cabg stents and brachytherapy who was admitted for an nsvt leading to fatigue and shortness of breath history of present illness the patients symptoms first developed last september when he noticed fatigue and shortness of breath he had recently developed bacteremia after colonoscopy and never felt that he had quite recovered he was being treated with atenolol mg at the time for his coronary artery disease his wife and son who are nurse and pa respectively felt his pulse and it was frequently in the but was also occasionally normal he decreased his atenolol to mg once day but his symptoms persisted he was seen as an outpatient and found to have frequent pvcs on ekg over the past few months the patient has also noticed increased angina both with and without activity he has had increased difficulty walking up the stairs causing chest pain and shortness of breath that are relieved by sublingual nitroglycerin then two days prior to admission the patient also noticed pain at rest but was again relieved by sublingual nitroglycerin on the morning of admission he felt chest heaviness that woke him up from sleep he did not take any nitroglycerin but his wife told him that he was gasping for breath over the past month he had been seeing his cardiologist dr verdun because of his shortness of breath he was started on lasix for days but this also did not relieve his symptoms he had holter monitoring with exercise going up and down the stairs at clinic and this also showed frequent pvcs he had an electrocardiogram that showed an ejection fraction of past medical history he had coronary artery bypass graft in and he had pci of his left main coronary artery and ptca and brachytherapy secondary to in stent restenosis in april intervention his left main was radiated his bypass vessels are lima lad svg marginal lima lad svg rpda he had significant gi bleed secondary to aspirin and plavix in his hematocrit went to the patient has remained on aspirin and plavix secondary to

admission sodium potassium chloride bicarb bun creatinine his baseline is glucose white count hematocrit platelets liver function tests were within normal limits ck mb troponin electrocardiogram showed right bundle branch block and beats of normal sinus rhythm interspersed with nsvt hospital course cardiovascular ischemia it was unclear whether the patients worsening chest pain was from progression of his coronary artery disease or whether this was demand ischemia from his frequent nsvt he was ruled out for myocardial infarction by enzymes but given the persistence of his arrhythmia he was taken for catheterization his catheterization showed an lad lesion diag lesion left circumflex lesion the ramus was widely patent rca showed lesion right pda lesion overall his lima graft to the lad was widely patent his svg graft to marginal and svg graft to rca were both occluded but had collaterals what was new from his previous catheterization was disease in his pda it was determined to further treat the patients coronary artery disease with medical management after his heart rate was controlled with amiodarone and with pacemaker he did however continue to have some fatigue and shortness of breath as result he had an adenosine mibi to evaluate for functional ischemia given the findings on his catheterization the mibi showed moderate sized perfusion defect throughout the inferior and basal inferoseptal and inferolateral walls showing moderate amount of reversibility his ejection fraction was estimated at with akinesis of the inferior and inferoseptal walls with reduced thickening he did not have any ekg changes during the procedure his beta blockade was increased to lopressor and he continued on his nitrates he was actually able to tolerate ambulation without feeling any pain or shortness of breath it is possible that the symptoms that he had later on in the hospitalization were secondary to volume overload which responded well to diuresis he will follow up with dr rafi it is unlikely that any intervention will be able to be done but he will explore this as an outpatient pump the patient did experience some shortness of breath several days into his admission he had been approximately four liters positive over several days he was given mg of iv lasix and responded well he was sent home with mg of lasix monday and thursday rhythm the patients electrocardiogram and telemetry strips were concerning because while he was technically in normal sinus rhythm he was usually only in normal sinus rhythm for beats at time at most and in between that had several runs of nsvt the nsvt never progressed to sustained tac and the patient was always hemodynamically stable however there was concern that this could ultimately progress to ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation he was loaded on amiodarone mg which he tolerated well he also required an additional mg iv load to stabilize his rhythm he had an icd and ddi pacemaker placed on without complication after the pacemaker was placed he was still experiencing some fatigue and it was thought that he may have been overpaced as result his settings were adjusted to increase his av delayed and he was changed to ddd mode he also had number of beats shortened that would be required to detect the vt to by the time of discharge his amiodarone was decreased to mg this may ultimately be decreased even further to but will be decided by dr swymer endocrinology the patient has history of diabetes we held his metformin on admission because of his catheterization but restarted it upon discharge any elevated blood sugars were covered with an insulin sliding scale pulmonary as mentioned above the patient did have some shortness of breath which was likely due to volume overload he responded well to mg iv lasix he always maintained his oxygen saturations he will have pulmonary function tests as an outpatient to establish baseline given his new treatment with amiodarone heme the patient does have history of gi bleed on aspirin and plavix we monitored his hematocrit closely he came in at it did decrease to during his hospitalization he had an episode of bright red blood per rectum given his history of radiation proctitis and proctatitis it is not surprising that he had this he always remained hemodynamically stable and did not require any transfusions at baseline his hematocrit is probably closer to and it is likely that the was an elevation from decreased intake follow up stools were guaiac negative followup he will follow up as an outpatient with dr halvorson

diuresis was continued with mg iv lasix on basis she was diuresed until there was subsequent bump in her creatinine to after that point diuresis was slowly modified she was then placed back on regimen of mg of lasix that is the dosing of lasix on which she is discharged rhythm the patient has history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation that has been rate controlled with beta blocker on admission her digoxin was stopped she was evaluated by the ep service they recommended epicardial lead placement at surgery due to her tachybrady syndrome the patient was discharged on diltiazem mg she will have her medications modified status post her valvular repair in the very near future presurgical workup in addition to echo right and left heart cath the patient had tee performed tee showed normal left atrial appendage without evidence of localized thrombus st judes valve was well seated in the aortic position there was no significant aortic regurg that was noted st judes valve was well seated in the mitral position as well there was trace mild regurgitation noted there was slight asynchronous motion of the prosthetic valve apparatus that was noted the tricuspid valve was normal in appearance there was mild regurgitation present visualized portion of the thoracic aorta revealed minimal atheromatous plaque pulmonary the patient remained stable from her pulmonary standpoint she continued to sat well on room air she did not required any nebulizers during her stay gi the patient was initially admitted with some abdominal pain and also nausea and vomiting she had kub performed for question of potential bowel obstruction single frontal view of the abdomen was obtained and is reported in the final radiology report there was gas seen within the loops of small bowel as well as the colon there is no bowel dilatation seen the overall impression was no evidence of any high grade bowel obstruction it is likely that some of her pain was secondary to hepatic congestion the nausea and vomiting eventually resolved and perhaps this is some type of viral illness or gastroenteritis she did have some episode of diarrhea prior to admission along with some abdominal cramping the patient was continued on her ppi for gerd prophylaxis at one point she required increasing her dosage of nexium secondary to gerd like symptoms it seemed that increasing the amount of nexium she received precipitated some diarrhea she was returned to normal dosing of nexium mg while in house she was discharged on omeprazole mg which she will continue to take as an outpatient in addition she was given prescription for colace and also senokot today she should continue using heme her hematocrit remained relatively stable during her stay with averaging of to as far as her hematocrit we were not concerned with keeping her hematocrit or above at all times given her clean coronary arteries seen from the left and also right heart catheterization she did have slight dip in her hematocrit at one point requiring two units of packed red blood cells her hematocrit bumped appropriately to or she required no subsequent transfusions thereafter with regard to anticoagulation she was placed on the heparin drip at units per hour to maintain ptt between and secondary to her mechanical valves that are in place on discharge the patient was transitioned to lovenox mg with renal dosing she will continue to take this lovenox as an outpatient and stop it one to two days prior to her surgery as instructed she has home vna in place renal her bun and creatinine was relatively stable on admission it did elevate to as high as on her admission secondary to her ongoing diuresis when diuresis was held for several days given her markedly increased urine output and as she became more hydrated and euvolemic her creatinine returned to its baseline of she has no active issues now endocrine we appreciated the diabetes service for following her very closely while in house several modifications were made to her regimen while here to get good control of her blood glucose she was maintained on stable regimen of nph units in the morning nph units in the evening she also was placed on sliding scale she also received novolog of units in the morning with breakfast and also at dinner she was not receiving any of the novolog while at lunch she will continue to take this regimen in home all of her prescriptions were provided by carl mcclenahan who is following with the diabetes service they will become again involved with her care as she plans for surgery in the very near future infectious disease the patient was stable from an id standpoint during her entire admission on september the patient was noted to have an increase in her white blood cell count upwards towards the this was one day prior to planned surgery on april with dr villata to repair her aortic valve and also her mitral valve the surgery was delayed as result of this so an infectious workup could ensue she had urine sent that showed the suggestion of urinary tract infection levaquin was given for treatment of her uti surveillance cultures were drawn daily given the fact that she had right groin hematoma that performed after the heart catheterization we questioned whether or not this could be some type of infectious source she had the hematoma aspirated it was negative for any organisms she had no other identified places as far as source of infection it was believed that she could potential have endocarditis as she has had in the past one of her cultures actually grew out species of abiotrophia there is only one culture positive that was taken on february she has had no subsequent cultures growing out at the time of this dictation we appreciate the infectious disease team following their recommendations were to hold antibiotics unless subsequent cultures began to grow out their recommendations were to continue to follow all cultures and to perform tee repeat tee was performed and showed no evidence of any lesions or change in bowel function there were clearly no vegetation seen on either any transthoracic echos or tees id made recommendations as far as perioperative antibiotics which would include two weeks of ceftriaxone iv under the assumption that this would be completing course of her therapy after sbe they would also recommend sending all valve tissue for gram stain and culture as well as pathology if the gram stain and culture were positive they would suggest extending the course of the above mentioned antibiotic therapy neurologic the patient was given darvon and also codeine as needed for her pain she complained of right groin pain secondary to the hematoma her pain is much improved that she is able to ambulate easily around the tl brown vo on discharge the hematoma is resolving and her pain is resolving as well fluids electrolytes and nutrition the patient is tolerating well her electrolytes were repleted as needed daily psychologic the patient was seen by social work it is clear that she has many anxieties about the surgery and also in going home and returning to her social environment she necessitated volume prior to many procedures given her severe anxiety disposition the patient is stable from medical standpoint with all cultures clear and no evidence of active infection her white blood cell count is now normal she is now awaiting surgical repair of her valve and will have surgery scheduled with dr berreth office in the next one to two weeks discharge medications diltiazem mg colace mg lasix mg other day nph

postoperative course was significant for contrast induced oliguric acute renal failure renal consult was obtained on and the patient was seen by dr studdard to evaluate her acute on chronic renal failure dr cowlin that her acute renal failure may be due to chronic kidney disease from renovascular disease or possibly due to interstitial nephritis in the setting of drug allergy the patient was also seen by dr shope erik garret manuel from the nephrology department while she was an inpatient after consideration of possibilities causing her acute renal failure it was thought that her acute renal failure was most likely due to cholesterol emboli syndrome given her eosinophilia stepwise progression of renal impairment and her chronic course the patient will need to be followed by nephrologist as an outpatient in addition the patient has known renal artery stenosis that may have contributed to her acute renal failure and she did have possible drug allergy to diuril and perhaps component of her renal failure was also due to acute interstitial nephritis on the patient developed gross hematuria at this time the urinalysis showed red blood cells but no evidence for atn this gross hematuria was in the setting of worsened coagulopathy she had renal ultrasound at that time that was negative for renal obstruction gradually with resolution of her coagulopathy the patients urine output increased and her creatinine improved with supportive measures alone the patient did have gradual improvement in her urine output and her creatinine decreased to prior to discharge the patient is currently off diuretics at this time daily weights should be checked and if her weight increases by more than pounds dr bockoven should be notified the patient was also started on

examination with an oxygen requirement elevation of her jvp and shortness of breath she was diuresed with lasix during her postoperative course the patient was transferred to the medical service on for management of her renal failure and volume overload the patient did undergo trial of renally dosed dopamine to see if this medication improved her cardiac output and renal function the patient showed no improvement on this medication and it was discontinued after short trial the patients diuresis was discontinued prior to discharge as the patient did have acute worsening of her renal function which may have been related to over aggressive diuresis the patient was instead started on spironolactone for management of her congestive heart failure as stated above she should have daily

patient received one unit of packed red blood cells as well as units of ffp on as well as vitamin with much improvement in her coagulopathy and increase in her hematocrit to about the patient should not receive any heparin flushes the patient showed no evidence for dic or hemolysis her coagulopathy was most likely thought to be due to residual coumadin with factor deficiency in the setting of her decreased renal clearance at this time the results of the inhibitor screen are pending and should be followed up as an outpatient the patient was restarted on coumadin prior to discharge her inr goal

just two years ago and it was unclear whether or not her troponin leak was from epicardial coronary artery disease or from another source such as pericarditis or erosion from endocarditis into her myocardium also given the back pain there was concern for aortic dissection and chest ct was done on which showed no aortic dissection she was continued on heparin plavix aspirin and beta blocker and will be restarted on her ace inhibitor was not restarted in hospital by her pcp given her continued neck pain with endemic st changes which included depressions in through and her substantial elevation in her troponin to peak of catheterization was done that demonstrated thrombosis on om at the ostia which was thought to be embolic all her other coronary arteries appeared normal so this lesion was angioplastied to residual post procedure course was complicated by pulmonary edema with rising requirement she diuresed well with improvement to room air satting she again had neck pain in through depressions on just three days after the catheterization on this was medically managed because the dynamic changes did not return and thought to be left over plaque from the last lesion the

complained of any symptoms while walking pump wise her echo showed an ef of with preserved lv and rv function her old rvsp increased roughly to possible increase in mitral gradient the patient had had rvsp before and it had been increased at roughly to mmhg possible increase in mitral gradient and no veg on her echo though it was tough to evaluate given her artificial valve the patient then had tee which was negative for vegetation or thrombus it was thought that the thrombus she had already thrown to her om would most likely be the thrombus that she had had and there was none left on the valves for that reason patient was volume overloaded and was diuresed on torsemide po which seems to be good regimen for her as far as her dry weights seem to be around kilos maybe even kilos and she should

after the cath gi wise she is stable she got some simethicone for gas and bowel regimen she was doing well but given her continued pain gi and surgery consulted on her for question of mesenteric ischemia ct angiogram of the abdomen was performed with negative workup for mesenteric ischemia they thought that most of her discomfort was due to constipation fen wise we replaced her lytes also we put her on carnitine for diet supplementation renal wise the patient had increase in creatinine secondary to the dye load from the cath and both her ct scans the creatinine was on day of discharge we held off on starting the ace because of this but she should consider getting an ace to add to her regimen given her diabetes and recent mi that should be started as an outpatient endocrine wise her

urinalysis was notable for protein trace keto blood leukocyte esterase to whites and squamous cells assessment in the emergency room the patient was acutely treated for presumed sepsis and received dose of ceftriaxone and clindamycin urinalysis results indicated that she had potential urinary tract infection at that time blood cultures were drawn and the patient received iv hydration her ekg was noted to have new wave inversions as compared to previously with an indeterminate troponin she was admitted to medicine for management hospital course the patients hospital course can be summarized as follows cardiovascular the patient has no known cardiac history her cardiac risk factors include cigarette smoking and postmenopausal female age no diabetes mellitus no known hypercholesterolemia no known family history she does however drink heavily and has done so for number of years she has no known cardiotoxic effect secondary to alcohol the wave inversions were noted with an indeterminate troponin the patient was admitted in rule out protocol she ruled out for an myocardial infarction with serial cks which were all below her wave inversions persisted despite resolution of her sinus tachycardia an echocardiogram was obtained which demonstrated dilated left ventricle of cm and an ejection fraction of to with inferoseptal and inferoseptal apical akinesis no ventricular thrombus was noted cardiology consultation service was asked to see the patient to evaluation her in the setting of her new depressed ejection fraction and focal wall motion abnormalities initially she was presumed to have coronary disease which had been clinically silent prior to this she was treated with aspirin lopressor and captopril mg three times day unfortunately the patients blood pressure did not tolerate this antihypotensive regimen and despite efforts to scale it back in dosages the majority of the medicines were held nevertheless the patients heart rate slowed to the she experienced one episode of burning chest pain on the night of admission which was alleved with maalox there were no ekg changes associated with that pain the patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization lab on september the cardiac catheterization was notable for right atrial pressure of right ventricular pressure of pulmonary artery pressure was and the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was her cardiac output was with an index of the left heart catheterization noted normal coronary arteries without evidence of significant coronary disease her left ventriculogram also noted preserved ejection fraction with no focal wall motion abnormalities dr garret dalrymple of the cardiac consultation service followed the patient in house and felt that the reversal of her wall motion abnormalities could be attributable to the acute effects of alcoholic cardiotoxicity the patient will be discharged on aspirin for primary prevention of coronary disease as her other medications were discontinued the patient was heparinized for her apical wall motion abnormality and low ejection fraction while in house and the heparin was discontinued at the time of catheterization gi the patient presented with an acute elevation of her transaminases the patients transaminases were noted to be less than in september of initially it was felt that these transaminases might reflect alcoholic hepatitis given her significant alcohol history the patient reports that her last drink was on sunday prior to admission she drinks about pint of brandy every day the patients transaminases continued to rise however the diagnosis of acute tylenol toxicity superimposed upon hepatocellular damage from alcoholic hepatitis was also entertained she was empirically started on naphthyl cystine and received approximately two to three doses however that medication was discontinued upon gi consultation the patients transaminases rose to level of approximately ast and alt and the gi service was consulted the patients hepatitic serologies were sent and were notable for positive hepatitis core antigen whereas the rest of her hepatitis serologies including hepatitis hepatitis and hepatitis surface antigen were negative the gi service felt that her hepatocellular injury was most likely attributable to an ischemic shock liver condition she had right upper quadrant ultrasound as well which demonstrated dilatation of the common bile duct to cm with some biliary sludging but no evidence of obstructive lesions given the patients isolated increase in ast and alt and bilirubin without an increase in alkaline phosphatase the diagnosis of ischemic hepatotoxicity was entertained by the gi service on the date of discharge the patients alt had fallen to and her ast had fallen to her total bilirubin had fallen to the patient was asymptomatic from hepatic perspective throughout her hospitalization without any evidence of encephalopathy or asterixis an isolated ammonia level was sent and it was infectious disease the patient had repeat urinalysis that was sent on the morning following admission which was indicative of urinary tract infection urine culture eventually indicated an infection with enterococcus the patient received seven days of ampicillin while in house following her initial first day dosing of ceftriaxone and clindamycin the patients urinary tract infection clear symptomatically she developed yeast infection in her vulvar area secondary to antibiotic therapy and this was treated with topical nystatin the patient was not discharged on antibiotics as she clinically cleared her infection fvn the patient had persistent hypomagnesemia while in house and required significant magnesium repletion the etiology of this hypomagnesemia was unclear however it was attributable to her chronic alcohol use and depletion of total magnesium stores her electrolytes clearly need to be followed closely as an outpatient hematologic the patients inr slightly increased while in house but this is attributable to heparin bolus and supratherapeutic prothrombin time upon discharge the patients inr had normalized she received vitamin mg days as empiric treatment for vitamin depletion secondary to chronic alcoholism as well as the possibility for hepatic synthetic dysfunction hypotension the patients initial presentation for hypotension was attributable to dehydration however it became clear that the patient normally exists with low normal blood pressure of approximately to systolic it was stressed to the patient that she must maintain adequate intake to maintain her circulating blood volume as she seemed to be intolerant to the antihypotensive medicines that were used for cardioprotection random cortisol was drawn and was normal the issue of potential renal insufficiency was most likely excluded the patient will follow up on endocrine and electrolyte issues with her primary doctor discharge medications folic acid mg day

cagan her outpatient oncologist she has virtually no evidence of metastatic disease on ct over the past few months the patient has had chronic problems with nausea and decreased appetite this has become especially acute over the past week and as result her chemotherapy is now on hold she has also had some worsening diarrhea for which she was prescribed imodium but because of ongoing issues with compliance it was felt that she was not taking enough at home during an outpatient visit with her cardiologist her blood pressure was noted to be so her dose of atenolol and lasix was decreased of note the patient is status post recent admission to mh for digoxin toxicity so this medication is now also on hold of note the patient is not currently on coumadin despite history of atrial

hospital course gi colitis given the patients persistent and chronic nausea vomiting and diarrhea there was significant concern for small bowel obstruction on admission however kub and abdominal ct were both negative for small bowel obstruction she was originally kept for bowel rest and nasogastric tube was placed with significant drainage stool studies were sent including difficile ova and parasites cecal leukocytes and shigella salmonella yersinia campylobacter studies all of which were negative because of the concerning nature of the patients symptoms surgery consult was called however they felt that her problems were likely nonsurgical in nature cts performed two days and five days after admission showed identical findings of right sided colitis they remained largely unchanged nevertheless the patient experienced continued nausea and vomiting and also continued diarrhea throughout this time once her nasogastric tube output decreased significantly approximately one week after admission the tube was removed and the patient was started on and her diet was advanced as tolerated from that point on the patient had no nausea or vomiting and she is currently tolerating full diet nevertheless she continues to have mild diarrhea now two episodes per day as compared to to episodes per day prior to admission in the end the workup for the underlying cause of her nausea vomiting and diarrhea has been negative it is therefore our suspicion that her symptoms are most likely secondary to toxicity from her chemotherapy medication xeloda of note the patient also has other signs of xeloda toxicity including possible hepatotoxicity see below as well as severe cracking and drying of the skin on her hands and feet hepatitis ct performed on admission to evaluate for small bowel obstruction showed significantly cirrhotic and fatty liver with no masses on admission the patients total bilirubin was however her bilirubin levels escalated precipitously to maximum of at the same time the patient developed clinical manifestations of this including scleral icterus and jaundice also as her albumin levels decreased to below she developed significant ascites and peripheral edema gastroenterology consult suggested right upper quadrant ultrasound which was negative for obstruction hepatic mri which also showed cirrhotic and fatty liver and also diagnostic therapeutic ir guided paracentesis which drained liter of sterile fluid hepatitis serologies were also sent and the patient was hepatitis and negative but positive however her viral load was less than assay and her afp was within normal limits rheumatologic workup for autoimmune hepatitis was also negative because of the acuteness and the timing of her presentation it was felt that her liver failure was likely secondary to combination of hepatitis and also toxicity from her xeloda on discharge the patients hepatic function had been improving significantly for three days with her albumin increasing her inr decreasing and her bilirubin levels also decreasing on discharge her total bilirubin was down from her albumin was up from and her inr was down from it is anticipated that as the patients nutritional status continues to improve her hepatic function will continue to normalize with resulting normalization of her laboratory values cardiovascular on admission the patient was in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response at the rate of approximately beats per minute she was also hypotensive with blood pressure of roughly she was placed on cardiac telemetry which recorded rapid fib up to the as result she was given iv lopressor with decreased heart rate but also significant reduction in her blood pressure requiring fluid boluses after hours after her blood pressure had stabilized following the administration of intravenous fluids she was started on diltiazem drip at mg per hour which helped to establish stable rate control in the with continued atrial fibrillation at the same time the patient was loaded with digoxin but her levels were high given that the patient was status post recent admission for digoxin toxicity this medication was subsequently held in one incident the patient developed temporary junctional rhythm for approximately minutes with heart rate in the at that point input was elicited from the cardiology consult service who thought that her symptoms were likely secondary to the diltiazem drip however given concern for tachy brady syndrome the possibility of an implantable cardiac pacemaker was discussed however the patient did not have any recurrence of the junctional rhythm tte was obtained which showed an ejection fraction of with trace mr and moderate tr left and right atrial enlargement and normal left and right ventricular function once the patient was again taking medications her diltiazem drip was changed to diltiazem for the next several days the patient had several episodes each night of to beat runs of nsvt however on the three days prior to discharge the patient had no events on telemetry and her heart rate was stable in the to with blood pressure running from shortly before discharge the patient also developed episodic shortness of breath which was attributed to mild pulmonary edema and she responded well to boluses of iv lasix as result she was restarted on aldactone with effective gentle diuresis the plan on discharge will be to follow her volume status carefully and to adjust her diuretic regimen as needed to maintain her volume status with continued improvement in her hepatic function endocrine the patient has history of diabetes mellitus and her metformin was held on admission secondary to an elevated creatinine as result she was started on lispro sliding scale given that she was for several days she was not given any insulin and her blood sugars remained stable in the low after she again started taking she was restarted on sliding scale and she maintained excellent blood sugar control between and hemoglobin obtained during this admission was also within normal limits of note the patient has left toe ulcer and was seen by orthopedic surgeries and outpatient totally before admission heme the patient had an inr of on admission secondary to cirrhosis and poor nutrition as result she was given vitamin subcu as needed as noted above despite history of atrial fibrillation the patient is not on coumadin at home secondary to poor med compliance at home she was only on aspirin but this was also discontinue during the admission secondary to continued guaiac positive stool nevertheless her hematocrit remained stable throughout her admission and she did not require any transfusions as dvt prophylaxis the patient was kept on pneumo boots throughout the admission at one point she was noted to have left upper extremity swelling greater than the right upper extremity but an ultrasound was negative for dvt as noted above on discharge the patients inr was improving secondary to improved nutrition she will be discharged without any anticoagulation at present however this can be further reevaluated as an outpatient by her cardiologist and oncologist fen the patient was initially rehydrated with normal saline however this was changed to plus amps of bicarb since she developed bicarb gap once this gap was closed she was given gentle normal saline as maintenance fluids once the patient started taking significant her iv fluids were discontinued the patients electrolytes were also repleted as necessary plan on discharge will be to continue following her electrolytes closely to prevent further exacerbation of her cardiac arrhythmias pain the patient was given oxycodone and morphine iv for pain the patient was previously on vioxx at home for orthopedic pain related to her diabetes however given recent data suggesting possible cardiotoxic effects of vioxx this will be discontinued and she will be sent home with oxycodone for pain onc the patients xeloda is currently on hold since many of her symptoms leading up to this admission were likely secondary to chemo toxicity as noted above the patient has other evidence of chemo toxicity as well including significantly dried skin on her hands and feet the patients outpatient oncologist dr willard brixius followed her closely during this admission and she will follow up with the patient regarding possible changes to her chemotherapy regimen disposition the patient was seen by the physical therapy service shortly before discharge and they noted that she displayed difficulty even moving from the bed to the chair which is significantly below her baseline of being able to ambulate independently as result after extensive discussions with her family it was decided that the patient will be best served by going to rehab facility for continued closed supervision of her medical problems supervised administration of her medication regimen continued strength training and conditioning and also continued nutrition once the patient is able to be less dependent on outside assistance she can be sent home with either home health aide or visiting nurse for continued rehabilitation of note the

stay for bipap and was gradually weaned to facemask over hours on day two of admission he was weaned to liters and was transferred to the floor where his respiratory management was continued on day of hospitalization the patient had been weaned to liters when he began coughing and abruptly desaturated to oxygen saturation with complaints of shortness of breath and chest pain and required nonrebreather the patient had no ekg changes and chest ray was unchanged from prior on the patient was given duoneb and chest pt he was stabilized and was able to be managed on the floor and transitioned back to liters at time of discharge he has been weaned to liters with oxygen saturation the patient does continue to desaturate with activities and requires further pulmonary rehabilitation including chest pt to remove mucus plugging noted on ct pe from earlier hospitalization in april pneumonia the patient presented with left lower lobe pneumonia he was started on

he will be discharged on levaquin for an additional seven day course of treatment for his pneumonia copd the patient has history of copd exacerbation and was most recently discharged on for mild copd exacerbation treated with duoneb and steroid taper during this hospital course the patient continued on duoneb treatments as well as steroid taper given his acute clinical course in this hospitalization the patient did not have pulmonary function test performed but with benefit from pft studies as an outpatient at time of discharge the patient is on liters of oxygen and is currently on prednisone mg which will be tapered to his home regimen of prednisone mg every other day hypertension the patient had been noted to have pulmonary artery pressure in in the but on this admission had an echo at time of admission that noted that his pulmonary artery pressure was now at mmhg the patient was followed by the insmotho erout hospital service to assess his pulmonary hypertension the

than minutes and the patient was in general asymptomatic from these arrhythmias although did occasionally did complain of some shortness of breath on occasion during these periods of arrhythmia the patient is being continued on lopressor mg endocrine the patient has history of type ii diabetes that was under diet control as an outpatient with steroid treatment for his copd exacerbation the patient did have his blood glucose measured regularly three times day and required regular insulin sliding scale for his steroid induced diabetes with tapering of the steroids the patients blood glucose has generally ranged between and has required less insulin while the patient is on steroids we will continue to monitor his blood glucose level and cover with insulin as needed the patient will follow up with his primary care physician and discuss further his overall need for oral hypoglycemic agents renal the patient has history of chronic renal insufficiency with baseline creatinine around at initial time of presentation his creatinine was and his lasix had been held however the patient developed lower extremity edema with shortness of breath and required lasix for his chf exacerbation his creatinine was followed closely during his hospital course and with lasix diureses his creatinine did rise slowly to however the benefits of diureses for chf exacerbation outweighed his chronic renal insufficiency state we would recommend that the patient follow up with his primary care physician to monitor his renal state fen during this hospital course the patients electrolytes were monitored and repleted as needed he had no acute issues regarding his electrolytes or nutritional status however the patient should continue on low salt sodium diet as well as limit his fluid

episodes of shortness of breath this time accompanied by jaw pain and with history of coronary artery disease and multiple risk factors concerning for acute coronary syndrome the patient was initially treated for possible ischemic event diagnosis of pe results were considered however the patient was not tachycardic she did not have any chest pain or new requirements and had had several workups for pulmonary embolism during prior hospitalization with similar systems so therefore this was thought to be less likely hospital course by system cardiac in terms of ischemia the patient had tests of cardiac enzymes which returned negative she was maintained on telemetry and she had ekg checked which did not reveal any changes this was patient who had dobutamine mibi which was negative for any evidence of ischemic changes during the mibi there was no evidence of ischemia and or scar the patient was continued on her outpatient medications including aspirin zocor and atenolol however at later point in her hospitalization she became hypotensive at which time her atenolol was temporarily dcd but this was restarted prior to discharge in terms of the patients cardiac function she has history of chf and is on lasix as an outpatient an echocardiogram was repeated during this hospitalization which was notable for an ef of trace to mild mr moderate tr and estimated pulmonary systolic pressure at mmhg the patient was continued on outpatient lasix regimen until at later point during this hospitalization the patient became hypertensive with acute renal failure at which time her lasix was discontinued lasix was restarted prior to discharge in terms of the patients rhythm she had no evidence of arrhythmias monitored throughout her hospitalization gi on the patient developed acute onset of diarrhea and lower abdominal pain now this pain was nonradiating alternating sharp and dull but constant associated with nausea and vomiting and frequent stools at times the stools were notable for bright red blood the patient was therefore started on levofloxacin and flagyl as treatment for diverticulitis versus ischemic colitis to further evaluate this ct scan of the abdomen was done which was notable for thickened colon for cm at the hepatic flexure given this information it was the gi consults opinion that this is most likely consistent with diverticulitis and the plan was to treat it aggressively with antibiotics and once the symptoms resolved recommended colonoscopy several weeks after discharge the patient was continued on levofloxacin and flagyl but then several days later became hypotensive with systolic blood pressures in the at this time the patients antibiotic coverage was changed to include ceptaz and vancomycin and she also received dose of gentamicin by the time of discharge the patients abdominal symptoms have completely resolved she is no longer having any abdominal pain and she needs no longer having any diarrhea and is tolerating regular diet without any difficulties the plan is for her to have followup colonoscopy as an outpatient pulmonary the patient was admitted for shortness of breath differential diagnosis at that time included chronic pulmonary embolism versus cardiac etiology versus deconditioning in the setting of chronic pulmonary fibrosis to establish that the patient did not have any pe she had lower extremity doppler exams which were negative she also had pt protocol ct which was negative for any evidence of clots because the patient does have cardiopulmonary hypertension she was started on coumadin as prophylaxis for any thrombosis in the setting of her low flow in her pulmonary vasculature throughout this hospitalization she was continued on her own home regimen of renal the patient has baseline chronic renal insufficiency with baseline creatinine at during this hospitalization at time that her diarrhea was very severe and when her blood pressures fell in the the patient developed acute renal failure with peak creatinine of with decreased urine output the thought of the team was that this represented renal failure in the setting of her diarrhea fluid losses and hypertension her pheno was consistent with this at she was treated with aggressive iv fluids she also had renal ultrasound which was normal she did have day of hematuria which was thought to be due most likely to foley trauma which resolved at the time of discharge id the patients hospital course was notable for diarrhea as mentioned in gi she was initially treated with levofloxacin and flagyl and then when she became hypertensive was then change her flagyl ceptaz and vancomycin with dose of gentamicin her symptoms dramatically improved on these antibiotics on she was changed from iv antibiotics to regimen of flagyl and levofloxacin the plan is for her to continue total of days of antibiotics anticipate the last day of antibiotic coverage will be rheumatology on the patient was noted to have left knee pain

takes insulin at home she was initially continued on an outpatient regimen however when she started to begin having massive diarrhea she was taken off her long acting insulin because she was not taking anything by at this time she was not tolerating regular diet and her insulin requirements were increasing it is recommended that as an outpatient she resumes one half of her regular outpatient insulin dose for or days to ensure that her insulin requirements in her diet are appropriate and then she should resume her regular insulin dosage discharge medications include aspirin mg atenolol mg
